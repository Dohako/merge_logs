# Merge logs
Simple testing in merging logs technologies

We have two files, that can be prepered with log generator, each file weight is about 1gb.

To run scripts you will need to give program arguments. 

## Example
* git clone
* python log_generator.py
* python main.py log/path/one log/path/two -o result/log/path
